This is the repository for my personal website, version 2: https://dylannicolet.netlify.app/

Feel free to visit, and donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if you see anything that could be improved.

## Tech Used

- Framework: [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) instead of CRA
- Styling: SCSS
- Deployment: Netlify
